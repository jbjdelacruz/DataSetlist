Background\n### 1.1 Introduction \n\nAs we reflected on the challenges faced by students in a remote learning environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, several key issues emerged. These included unreliable internet connectivity and the absence of appropriate learning devices, which hindered participation in synchronous classes and the submission of course requirements (Baticulon et al., 2020; Santos, 2020). Negative experiences such as limited engagement in synchronous lectures, increased distractions, difficulties in comprehending lessons, and delays in the exchange of responses and feedback also significantly impacted their overall learning experience (Bai et al., 2021). Furthermore, two surveys conducted by the UP System Committee on Remote Teaching and Learning in November 2020 and July 2021 revealed that 80% of students felt academically overwhelmed, while only 30% expressed satisfaction with their learning experiences (Lontoc, 2021).\n\nIn response to this dilemma, it is crucial to evaluate the academic effectiveness of prior remote learning systems to assist administrations in their decision-making processes. As highlighted by Joaquin et al. (2020), learning innovations must have a deeper understanding of what remote education is by looking at factors such as instructor’s capacity, student’s circumstance, and learning environment efficiency together with the more evident issues of network connection speed, cost of materials, and mode of instruction.\n\n### 1.2. Objectives\n\nThe main objective of this report was to analyze student responses from a survey on remote learning using exploratory and factor analyses. Specifically, it aims to:\n             \n1.\tDescribe respondents by demographics, student satisfaction with remote learning, and perceived academic performance.\n3.\tExamine relationships between the three aforementioned set of variables.\n4.\tIdentify the best latent factor structure for student satisfaction with remote learning.\n\n## 2. Exploratory Analysis\n\nAn online survey through Google Forms was used to collect data near the end of the first semester of Academic Year 2021-2022. Convenience sampling was employed due to limited resources, time, and the exploratory nature of the study. Participants were UP undergraduate students who were enrolled at the time.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Import data from CSV file\nsuppressMessages(library(tidyverse)) # required library\ndata <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/the-data-setlist/survey_data.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\n## Create functions to be used\nlibrary(dplyr) # required library\n\n# Tabularize a dataframe\n\nlibrary(DT)\nsummarize_variable <- function(data, variable=NULL, caption=NULL, dom=\"t\", searching=FALSE, rownames=FALSE, pageLength=10) {\n  if (is.null(variable)) {\n    datatable(data, \n                  class=\"cell-border stripe\", \n                  options = list(dom=dom, searching=searching, pageLength=pageLength),\n                  rownames=rownames,\n                  caption=if (!is.null(caption)) htmltools::tags$caption(\n                    style = 'caption-side: top; text-align: center;',\n                    caption\n                  ) else NULL)\n  } else {\n\tsummarized_data <- data %>%\n      filter(!!sym(variable) != \"No Data\") %>%\n      group_by(!!sym(variable)) %>%\n      summarise(Count = n(), .groups=\"drop\") %>%\n      {\n        if (is.ordered(data[[variable]])) {\n          arrange(., desc(!!sym(variable)))\n        } else {\n          arrange(., desc(Count))\n        }\n      } %>%\n      mutate(Percentage = label_percent(accuracy=0.01)(Count/sum(Count)))\n    \n    datatable(summarized_data %>% rename(!!variable := !!sym(variable)),\n                  class=\"cell-border stripe\", \n                  options = list(dom=dom, searching=searching, pageLength=pageLength),\n\t\t\t      rownames=rownames,\n                  caption=if (!is.null(caption)) htmltools::tags$caption(\n                    style = 'caption-side: top; text-align: center;',\n                    caption\n                  ) else NULL)\n  }\n}\n          \n\n# Create horizontal bar plot using base R graphics    \nsuppressMessages(library(rlang, verbose=FALSE, quiet=TRUE)) # required library               \nhoriz_barplot <- function(data,\n                          variable,\n                          summ_var = NULL,\n                          summ_fun = \"n\",\n                          na.rm = TRUE,\n                          others = FALSE,\n                          others.p = NULL,\n                          mar = c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1),\n                          col = \"steelblue\",\n                          title = NULL,\n                          xlab = NULL,\n                          ylab = NULL,\n                          xlim_adj = 0,\n                          ...) {\n\n  # --- 1.
